# Assignment
#Aim 1 - To develop a linear regression model without using any python library. 
For linear regression Salary dataset is used from Kaggle. 
Data transformation techniques like ordinal encoding, label encoding and one hot encoding are used to transform categorical data to numerical data.
Linear regression model without using any libraries is developed by gradient descent method.
The values of weights are initilized as 0.
Cost function and gradient descent is calculated,
hyperparameters are set to train the model and weights are updated in this process.
Output is predicted. 

#Aim 2 - To develop a logistic regression model without using any python library. 
For logistic regression loan dataset is used from Kaggle. 
Data transformation techniques like ordinal encoding, label encoding and one hot encoding are used to transform categorical data to numerical data.
Logistic regression model without using any libraries is developed by gradient descent method. Sigmoid function is used to calculate logistic regression
The values of weights are initilized as 0.
Cost function and gradient descent is calculated,
hyperparameters are set to train the model and weights are updated in this process.
Output is predicted. The accuracy of the model is 87%.
